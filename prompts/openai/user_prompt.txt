I need a commit message for the following changes on branch '%s'.

Files changed:
%s

Diff:
%s

Jira ID: %s

Jira Description: %s

Please provide a suitable commit message that follows our team's guidelines exactly:
1. First line must include the Jira issue ID specified above. If a Jira issue description is provided, include it here also.
2. Use the format: "<type>(<component>): <Jira ID> : <Jira Description>"
3. If no Jira ID is provided, use a placeholder (GTBUG-??? or GTN-???)
4. Analyze whether the change is a bugfix (GTBUG) or a feature (GTN) based on the nature of the changes
5. Make sure the first line is under 50 characters
6. Add a detailed description after a blank line
7. If a Jira description is provided, use it to provide context for the commit message

The component should reflect the primary area of code being changed. For a database change, use "db"; for UI changes, use "ui", etc.

VERY IMPORTANT: Provide only the commit message without any additional comments or explanations.
