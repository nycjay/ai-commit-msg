I need a commit message for the following changes on branch '%s'.

Files changed:
%s

Diff:
%s

Jira ID: %s

Please provide a suitable commit message that follows our team's guidelines exactly:
1. First line must include the Jira issue ID specified above
2. Use the format: "<type>(<component>): <Jira ID> <description>"
3. If no Jira ID is provided, use a placeholder (GTBUG-??? or GTN-???)
4. Analyze whether the change is a bugfix (GTBUG) or a feature (GTN) based on the nature of the changes
5. Make sure the first line is under 50 characters
6. Add a detailed description after a blank line

The component should reflect the primary area of code being changed. For a database change, use "db"; for UI changes, use "ui", etc.
