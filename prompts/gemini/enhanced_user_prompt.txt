====================

Please provide a commit message following this exact format:
1. First line: "JIRA-ID: Brief summary of the issue"
   - Example: "GTN-48046: Support a currency conversion function in datasets"
   - Use the exact Jira ID provided above
   - If a Jira description is provided above, use it for the first line summary
2. A blank line
3. Detailed description explaining WHY these changes were made and HOW they solve the problem

Specific guidelines:
1. First line MUST start with the exact Jira ID followed by colon and space
2. Make sure the first line is under 80 characters
3. If no Jira ID is provided, use a placeholder (GTBUG-??? or GTN-???)
4. Analyze whether the change is a bugfix (GTBUG) or a feature (GTN) based on the nature of the changes
5. Focus on the semantic meaning of the code changes, not just the syntax
6. Use bullet points for complex changes with multiple aspects
7. Explain the technical impact and business value of the change

Remember that your goal is to create a commit message that clearly explains the purpose and impact of the change to other developers reviewing the code.
