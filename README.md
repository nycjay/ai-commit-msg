# AI Commit Message Generator

A tool that uses Claude AI to automatically generate high-quality git commit messages based on your staged changes.

## Features

- ü§ñ Uses Claude AI to analyze your code changes and generate meaningful commit messages
- üìù Follows best practices for commit messages (conventional commits, imperative mood)
- üöÄ No dependencies - single binary distribution
- üîê Securely stores API key in macOS Keychain
- ‚úèÔ∏è Interactive mode allows you to edit messages before committing
- üîÑ Can be integrated directly into your git workflow

## Installation

### Building from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nycjay/ai-commit-msg.git
cd ai-commit-msg

# Build and install
./build.sh
```

## API Key Setup

You'll need an Anthropic API key to use this tool. The setup process is simple:

### 1. First-time setup (recommended)

Simply run the tool without any parameters:

```bash
ai-commit-msg
```

The tool will prompt you for your API key (input will be hidden) and offer to store it securely in your macOS Keychain.

### 2. Store directly in macOS Keychain

```bash
./ai-commit-msg --store-key --key your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Set as environment variable

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

1. Stage your changes with `git add`
2. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   ai-commit-msg
   ```
3. Review the suggested commit message
4. Choose to use it (y), edit it (e), or cancel (n)

### Command-line options

```
--key "your-api-key"    Specify your Anthropic API key
--store-key             Store the provided API key in Mac keychain
--auto                  Automatically commit using the generated message without confirmation
--verbose               Enable verbose output for debugging
--help                  Display help information
```

### Examples

Generate a commit message with interactive prompt:
```bash
ai-commit-msg
```

Generate and automatically commit:
```bash
ai-commit-msg --auto
```

Store API key in keychain:
```bash
ai-commit-msg --store-key --key sk_ant_your_key_here
```

### Git alias (optional)

You can create a git alias for easier access:

```bash
git config --global alias.claude '!ai-commit-msg'
```

Then use:
```bash
git claude
```

## Customizing Prompts

The tool uses Claude AI with carefully crafted prompts to generate commit messages. Developers can customize these prompts to change how the messages are generated:

### Available prompt files:

- `prompts/system_prompt.txt` - Contains instructions for the AI about commit message style and formatting
- `prompts/user_prompt.txt` - Template used to format the request to the AI with your git diff information

### When to customize:

- To change the commit message style (e.g., different format, more/less detail)
- To adapt messages for team-specific conventions
- To add specific requirements for your project

These customizations require rebuilding the tool since the prompts are compiled into the executable.

## Development and Testing

### Running Tests

The project includes unit tests to ensure all functionality works correctly. To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./pkg/key

# Run tests with code coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Generate code coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Testing Components

The tests are organized by component:

1. **API Key Management Tests** - Testing the handling of API keys from various sources:
   - Environment variables
   - macOS Keychain
   - Command-line arguments
   - Interactive input

2. **Git Integration Tests** - Testing the git diff extraction and commit functionality

3. **Message Generation Tests** - Testing the Claude API integration and message processing

4. **Argument Parsing Tests** - Testing command-line argument handling

### Mock Testing

Some tests use mock implementations to avoid dependencies on external systems:

- Keychain operations are mocked to avoid modifying the actual macOS Keychain
- Git operations can be mocked to test without a real git repository
- API calls to Claude are mocked to test without requiring a real API key

### Test Organization

Tests follow Go's standard pattern where test files are named `*_test.go` and placed alongside the code they test.

## Tips for best results

1. Stage only related changes together for more focused commit messages
2. For large changes, consider breaking them into smaller, logical commits
3. The tool works best when diff sizes are reasonable (under 4000 tokens)
4. Use the edit option to refine messages when needed
